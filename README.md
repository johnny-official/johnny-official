### 🚀 About Me
I am a builder focused on **secure delivery**, **automation**, and **infrastructure resilience**. My approach combines a cybersecurity background with modern DevOps practices to create reproducible and secure environments.

* **Current Focus:** Mastering Linux, Containerization (Docker/K8s), CI/CD pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
* **Philosophy:** Build → Document → Automate → Iterate.
* **Mindset:** Security-first (DevSecOps), Least Privilege, and Observability.
